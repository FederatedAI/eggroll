         *    which is suitable for the use from cached thread pool.
         * 2. If we don't specify a executor communication, underlying SimpleTimeLimit in guava will create one
         *    for each creation from SimpleTimeLimit instance. These creations are unnecessary performance expenses.
         *
         * In the future, if this creates or maintains too many threads, we need to optimize it. Possibly creates
         * own implementations.
         *
         * And if we need to specify thread pool name, the executorService needs to be created manually with params.
